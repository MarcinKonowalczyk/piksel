# Constants

## HALF_PI

`HALF_PI` is a mathematical constant with the value 1.5708. It is half the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. It is useful in combination with the trigonometric functions `sinf` and `cosf`.

```cpp
piksel::HALF_PI
```

## PI

`PI` is a mathematical constant with the value 3.14159. It is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. It is useful in combination with the trigonometric functions `sinf` and `cosf`.

```cpp
piksel::PI
```

## QUARTER_PI

`QUARTER_PI` is a mathematical constant with the value 0.785398. It is one quarter the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. It is useful in combination with the trigonometric functions `sinf` and `cosf`.

```cpp
piksel::QUARTER_PI
```

## TWO_PI

`TWO_PI` is a mathematical constant with the value 6.28319. It is twice the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. It is useful in combination with the trigonometric functions `sinf` and `cosf`.

```cpp
piksel::TWO_PI
```
