> A simple 2D graphics library for C++

## What is it?

piksel is a C++ library that offers you a collection of intuitive functions to create your own 2D graphics applications. These could be games, artistic visualizations or even highly sophisticated physics simulations. Prior knowledge of C++ is useful but not mandatory. piksel could as well be used as a tool to learn C++. Being OpenGL-based, piksel highly profits from hardware accelerated rendering. As a user of this library you will however never be exposed to any of the OpenGL-related API calls. piksel applications can be deployed natively or on the web through the power of WebAssembly.
